ofxRSSDK
========

openFrameworks addon for the Intel RealSense SDK and hardware, based off of ofxKinect.

_DISCLAIMER: It looks like a bunch of folks found their way here over the holiday judging from my inbox, and have probably figured by now that this is very incomplete.  That's my fault and I totally apologize, i'm developing this in tandem with another project and am not being very good about my commits.  For folks who are wanting to do production with this, fear not, I'll have a working version with samples and VERY BASIC functionality by the end of this week (2015-01-04).  Thanks for your patience!_
