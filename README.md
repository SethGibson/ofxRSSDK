ofxRSSDK
========

openFrameworks addon for the Intel RealSense SDK and hardware, based off of ofxKinect and ofxBase3DVideo by [Theo Watson](https://github.com/ofTheo/).

**Currently Supported:**
* Color Stream
* Depth Stream
* Depth-to-Camera Mapping

**TODO: Week of 2015.01.12**
* Face Location and Landmark Detection
* VS2012 Projects

**In Development**
* Hand and Finger Tracking
* Gesture recognition
* Code::Blocks projects
* projectGenerator support

This should be considered experimental and unfinished until some sort of official v1.0-ish announcement.  Expect to see parity with the current RealSense SDK (non-experimental features only).  If there's a specific feature you need right away, please let me know.
