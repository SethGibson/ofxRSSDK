ofxRSSDK
========

openFrameworks addon for the Intel RealSense SDK and hardware, based off of ofxKinect.

Currently Supported:
* Color Stream
* Depth Stream
* Depth-to-Camera Mapping

This should be considered experimental and unfinished until some sort of official v1.0-ish announcement.  Expect to see parity with the current RealSense SDK.  If there's a specific feature you need right away, please let me know.
